## Excercises
### 1. Merge (fast-forward) 
Two branches, only the other one diverges. 
Best common ancestor is the tip of the  main branch, so new commits will be placed on top of that without a merge commit (fast forward). 
```plaintext
foo      B - C  
       /        =>   
main A              A - B - C
```
